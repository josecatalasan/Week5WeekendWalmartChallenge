# Week5WeekendWalmartChallenge
This application was built in Kotlin and uses Retrofit and RxJava to make an API call from the Open Weather API. The MainActivity hold 2 FrameLayouts to hold the 2 fragments. One fragment holds the information from the Current Weather API call, and the other fragment should hold the information of the Weather Forecast API. The information for the Current Weather Fragment is handled by the CurrentWeatherViewModel. The views within the Current Weather Fragment are bound to the CurrentWeatherViewModel and are updated after the ViewModel makes an API call. The Current Weather Fragment also has 2 ImageButtons. One ImageButton uses a DialogBox to ask the user for a zip code, saves the input to SharedPreferences, makes an API call with that zip code, and updates the fragment's information. The other ImageButton changes the temperature conversions from imperial to metric and vice-versa. When the application is first started, the dialog box for user input is shown, and the zip code is saved to SharedPreferences.
